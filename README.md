This website has game reviews which are divided into categories. Each review has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an review. Users can also add comments about a review.

## The Process

The intention here was to build a fully interactive Frontend UI with `React` to take advantage of a Restful back API I built previously. This project consolidated my understanding of making `C.R.U.D` applications from a frontend perspective. I took a mobile first approach with the building of this app, utilising react hooks such as useSate and useEffect and routing with React Router.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
